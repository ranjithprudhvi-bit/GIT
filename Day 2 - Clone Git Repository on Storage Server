The DevOps team established a new Git repository last week, which remains unused at present. However, the Nautilus application development team now requires a copy of this repository on the Storage Server in the Stratos DC. Follow the provided details to clone the repository:


1.	The repository to be cloned is located at /opt/media.git

2.	Clone this Git repository to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Perform this task using the natasha user, and ensure that no modifications are made to the repository or existing directories, such as changing permissions or making unauthorized alterations.
Below is the exact, safe procedure to clone the Git repository as per the requirements, with clear explanation of each command. This follows KodeKloud / Nautilus task standards (no permission or repo changes).
________________________________________
🔧 Task Summary
•	Source repo: /opt/media.git (bare repository)
•	Destination: /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
•	User: natasha
•	Restriction: ❌ No permission changes, ❌ No repo modifications
________________________________________
✅ Step-by-Step Commands (with Explanation)
1️⃣ Login to Storage Server as natasha
ssh natasha@ststor01
🔹 Logs into the Storage Server using the correct user (natasha).
________________________________________
2️⃣ Verify Git is installed
git --version
🔹 Confirms Git is already installed.
⚠️ Do NOT install or modify packages unless explicitly asked.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Navigate to the destination directory
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
🔹 Moves into the directory where the repository must be cloned.
🔹 Directory already exists — do not create or modify it.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone /opt/media.git
🔹 Clones the bare repository from /opt/media.git
🔹 A new directory media will be created automatically
🔹 This operation is read-only safe and does not alter the source repo
________________________________________
5️⃣ Verify the clone
ls
🔹 Confirms that the repository was cloned successfully.
(Optional)
cd media && git status
🔹 Ensures repository integrity (should show clean working tree).

📌 Important Notes (Why this is Correct)
✔ Used correct user (natasha)
✔ Did not change permissions
✔ Did not modify the source repository
✔ Followed enterprise Git best practices
✔ Matches real-world DevOps workflows

🧠 Key Concept (Quick Reminder)
•	Bare repositories are used as central repositories
•	They cannot be edited directly
•	Developers clone them to work locally
