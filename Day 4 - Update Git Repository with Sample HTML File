The Nautilus development team has initiated a new project development, establishing various Git repositories to manage each project's source code. Recently, a repository named /opt/cluster.git was created. The team has provided a sample index.html file located on the jump host under the /tmp directory. This repository has been cloned to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on the storage server in the Stratos DC.

1.	Copy the sample index.html file from the jump host to the storage server placing it within the cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster.
2.	Add and commit the file to the repository.
3.	Push the changes to the master branch.


TASK OVERVIEW (What we need to do)

Copy index.html from jump host → storage server

Place it inside the cloned Git repo:

/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster


Add the file to Git

Commit the change

Push it to the master branch

⚠️ Important:

Use thor on jump host

Use natasha on storage server

Do not change permissions unnecessarily

🧩 STEP 1: Copy index.html from Jump Host to Storage Server
📍 On jump host (user: thor)
scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp/

🔍 Explanation

scp → Secure Copy Protocol (copy files over SSH)

/tmp/index.html → Source file on jump host

natasha@ststor01:/tmp/ → Destination on storage server

We copy it to /tmp first (safe staging location)

🧩 STEP 2: Login to Storage Server
ssh natasha@ststor01

🔍 Explanation

Logs into the storage server where the Git repository exists

🧩 STEP 3: Move the file into the cloned Git repository
mv /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/

🔍 Explanation

Moves the file into the working directory of the Git repo

This makes Git trackable changes possible

🧩 STEP 4: Navigate to the Git repository
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster

🔍 Explanation

All Git commands must be run inside the repository

🧩 STEP 5: Check Git status
git status

🔍 Explanation

Confirms Git has detected index.html as a new/untracked file

Always check before committing (best practice)

🧩 STEP 6: Add the file to Git staging area
git add index.html

🔍 Explanation

Moves the file from working directory → staging area

Only staged files get committed

🧩 STEP 7: Commit the file
git commit -m "Added sample index.html file"

🔍 Explanation

Saves the change permanently in local Git history

-m → Commit message (clear and meaningful)

🧩 STEP 8: Push changes to master branch
git push origin master

🔍 Explanation

origin → Remote repository (/opt/cluster.git)

master → Branch name

Uploads your commit to the central repository

✅ FINAL RESULT

✔ index.html copied correctly
✔ Added to Git repository
✔ Committed with proper message
✔ Pushed to master branch
✔ Repository now updated for all developers

🧠 WHAT YOU LEARNED (Very important)

This task covered multiple DevOps fundamentals:

SSH & SCP file transfer

Working with multiple servers

Git working directory vs staging area vs repository

Safe production practices

Real-world collaboration workflow

This is exactly what DevOps engineers do daily.
